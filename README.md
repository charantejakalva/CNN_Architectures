# CNN_Architectures
This Project is designed with an objective to observe the effect of regularizations like Batch
normalization and Dropout on various deep networks like VGGNet, ResNet and Inception
V2. This project helps us to understand how different networks behave under different
settings. We also explore the networks with different optimizers like SGD and ADAM


In this project I have implemented a total of 18 variants of deep neural networks with different
settings of VGG, Resnet and Inceptionv2 over CIFAR-100 dataset.  Report.pfd has the
values for recall, precision and accuracy for all the variants.
